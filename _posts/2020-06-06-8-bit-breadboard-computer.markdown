I started working on it on and off, since July 2019. Burnt a few chips and stripped hundreds feet of wires.

The following is a video of the computer running a program on the right. It ran a loop that keeps adding 10, until it overflowed and halted the clock.

Because I burnt the 74LS138 demux, I decided to run the computer without it. So each instruction takes full 8 clock cycles unnecessarily. So you would see a lot of the time when the computer is not doing anything.

I highly recommend Ben Eater's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc).
